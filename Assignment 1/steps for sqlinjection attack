First of all, we launched the website www.vulnweb.com
Next, we launched the terminal on kali linux
then, we navigated to the website http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1.
this link was used for the sql injection attack. 
on the terminal, we used the command, sqlmap -u “http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1” --dbs
we knew the database used was MySQL, we dumped the data too. 
The data is saved in a file as log and session in the assignment.
